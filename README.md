# SM1AC (Spoof M1 Apple Chips)

**SM1AC** is a community-driven experiment to figure out how Hackintosh can stick around past Intel Macs by messing with QEMU-based virtualization and spoofing Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) chip identifiers.

## Project Goal
Keep Hackintosh kickin’ after macOS "Tahoe" by:
- Messing with Apple Silicon spoofing in **QEMU/KVM**  
- Building shims/layers to trick macOS into thinking it’s chillin’ on Apple hardware  
- Dropping research, configs, and tools for the whole community  

## Current Focus
- Getting QEMU up and running for ARM64 emulation  
- Playing with CPUID & device-tree spoofing  
- Writing down experiments and gotchas  

## How to Get Involved
1. Hop into the Discord: [LinuxIsBetter](https://discord.gg/qawDTR6Wg2)  
2. Check out issues in this repo for what’s cookin’  
3. Toss in QEMU configs, patches, or docs if you’ve got ‘em
