# SM1AC (Spoof M1 Apple Chips)

**SM1AC** is a community-driven experiment to explore how Hackintosh can survive beyond Intel Macs by experimenting with QEMU-based virtualization and spoofing Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) chip identifiers.

## Project Goal
Keep Hackintosh alive after macOS "Tahoe" by:
- Experimenting with Apple Silicon spoofing in **QEMU/KVM**  
- Building shims/layers to trick macOS into thinking it's running on Apple hardware  
- Sharing research, configs, and tools with the community  

## Current Focus
- Setting up QEMU for ARM64 emulation  
- Exploring CPUID & device-tree spoofing  
- Documenting experiments and limitations  

## How to Get Involved
1. Join the Discord: [LinuxIsBetter](https://discord.gg/qawDTR6Wg2)  
2. Check out the issues in this repo for ongoing tasks  
3. Contribute QEMU configs, patches, or documentation
